# IAmTwo
A puzzle game with a little twist, that had been worked on since 4th Febuary 2021.
As basis it uses my SMRendererV3 to render the game.

## General idea
The game bases around a character, that has a "Mirror". Means a second character, that moves the oppisite.
Both need to teverse the levels to continue.
Additionally the game will have a level editor, so you can create your own levels.
